      "How to find an internship We are in fact the DD I had a year to know what I wanted to do later. My goal was to have all the chances on my side to finally find a job at the end of tomorrow 2nd year. Furthermore, doing an internship would allow me to understand how the American job market works and what its expectations are. That's why I started looking for an internship in August. I discovered first that I was not the only one in this market, and that I had to stand out. So, I played on my European background and my first master's degree in finance. I'm mainly looking for interns in fintech. Why this choice? So that I could link my 2 masters, Finance and Business Analytics, and learn as well in the 2 fields in order to make my choice after my 2nd year. I had found an excellent internship in a fintech but not being familiar with foreign students they didn't understand that I had constraints. My first constraint was my start date; I could not start until October. This was detrimental to me because in the American job market we can start overnight. Then they sent me a contract as if I was a permanent resident, even though I had explained to them that I was on an F1 visa with a CPT. Despite the fact that they took me they stopped answering me and cancelled the contract and I found myself on an internship. That's when I understood that I had to be careful during my interviews to explain my situation and not to consider myself as an employee. I didn't sign all my papers, but this misadventure taught me a lot and I had to bounce back as soon as possible to find an internship. I asked a friend who had done an internship last year for advice and she recommended Impact Business Development Consulting as a business analyst intern. This company had already contacted me on LinkedIn, so I chose to do my internship with them.   The first few months This was not the first time I worked for a company. I had already worked for communication agencies for theaters and associations, but this was the first time I worked in a virtual environment. When you work virtually you have to have a personal rigor. Indeed, we have to stick to our office hours and not let ourselves get distracted. I'm not a person like that, so when I'm given a job, I do it, so it wasn't a problem for me. The problem was much more having office hours at the same time as the others. Indeed, having classes in the evening, bothered me a lot for my internship because my boss had meetings with his clients during the day and in the evening and he made a summary of the tasks to do for the next day. However, in this configuration, the choice of my classes that was imposed on our cohort was not adapted. So, I had to manage between classes and the internship to finally be on time for both. At first, my boss had a hard time understanding that I had classes and homework. Indeed, I always did my tasks before the date requested by my boss, but he systematically added other tasks to finish before the usual ones. Normally this method of working suits me perfectly because in the world of work unexpected things can happen. However, since I only work 15 hours a week for IBDC, I could not complete the traditional tasks without taking time away from my master's work. It took him some time, but he managed to understand that my priority was my master's degree. As the months went by, my tasks became more and more intense, which I enjoyed. In the beginning, I only had to enter data into databases and then as the months went by, I was able to create my databases, analyze them, classify them, order them, and visualize them to create presentations for our clients. I mainly used the 2 tools: Python and Microsoft Excel, because my databases were way too small to use, and python was a better alternative for me than RStudio.   What I remembered Compared to my expectations, my internship did not necessarily bring me new knowledge. However, it allowed me to deepen my skills already acquired during my schooling and my different previous positions. Thus, I was able to discover the American market, the functioning of an international company on the American threshold, and the different stakes that this implies. Indeed, a company on the American threshold is much more conducive to trade. I was more in contact with people coming from all over the world like Italians with the international than a European company more particularly French. I was able to work with people from all over the world: Canadian, Italian, French, American, Belgian, and English. Therefore, I was able to familiarize myself with an international company called the world.  Moreover, I learned that I could be in contradiction with my employer and find a common ground to work better together. It is possible that in my future positions I will perform tasks that I do not necessarily like, but I learned during this internship to always know how to adapt to situations. I would have liked to be in person and not virtual during this internship, but it allowed me to have a foot in my dream city New York. An internship is always a rewarding experience no matter what and I am glad I had the opportunity to do an internship at the same time as my master's degree. \n"
